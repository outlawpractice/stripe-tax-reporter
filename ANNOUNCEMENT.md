**Title:** Open Source CLI Tool for Multi-State Sales Tax Reporting

**Post:**

Hi Stripe Community! 👋

I built an open-source CLI tool to generate multi-state sales tax reports from Stripe invoices, and wanted to share it with the community.

### The Problem

Stripe's built-in reporting is great, but if you operate in multiple states and need quarterly tax reports:
- Manual CSV exports require spreadsheet manipulation
- Grouping by state is tedious
- Stripe fees aren't included in standard reports
- No easy way to generate per-state subtotals

### The Solution: Stripe Tax Reporter

**GitHub:** https://github.com/outlawpractice/stripe-tax-reporter

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatic multi-state grouping with per-state subtotals
- ✅ Includes Stripe processing fees
- ✅ Excel-ready tab-delimited output
- ✅ Automatic previous quarter detection
- ✅ Three-level address fallback (customer → billing → invoice)
- ✅ Free and open source (MIT License)

**Example Output:**
```
===== CALIFORNIA (CA) =====
Date	Customer	Users	Licenses	Tax	Total	Fees
10/20/2025	Acme Corp	5	200.00	17.00	217.00	6.90
Subtotal			200.00	17.00	217.00	6.90

===== TEXAS (TX) =====
Date	Customer	Users	Licenses	Tax	Total	Fees
10/15/2025	Margaglione Law PLLC	7	280.00	22.40	302.40	9.42
Subtotal			280.00	22.40	302.40	9.42

GRAND TOTAL			480.00	39.40	519.40	16.32
```

**Usage:**
```bash
export STRIPE_PROD_API_KEY="sk_live_..."
stripe-tax-reporter
```

The tool is written in Rust for speed and reliability. It uses the Stripe API to fetch invoices, customers, and balance transactions, then generates formatted reports automatically.

### Use Cases

Perfect for:
- SaaS businesses operating in multiple states
- Quarterly sales tax filing
- Finance teams needing clean Stripe reports
- Anyone tired of manual CSV manipulation

### Technical Details

- Fetches paid invoices for previous fiscal quarter
- Groups by state automatically
- Extracts actual Stripe fees from balance transactions
- Three-level fallback for state information (maximizes coverage)
- Strict validation ensures data accuracy
- Open source - contributions welcome!

## 💼 LinkedIn Post

Excited to announce that we've open-sourced one of our internal tools: Stripe Tax Reporter! 🎉

As a SaaS business operating in multiple states, we needed a better way to generate quarterly sales tax reports from Stripe. The built-in reporting required too much manual work - exporting CSVs, grouping by state, calculating subtotals, etc.

So we built a CLI tool that:
• Automatically groups invoices by state
• Generates per-state subtotals
• Includes Stripe processing fees
• Outputs Excel-ready format
• Detects the previous fiscal quarter automatically

We figured other businesses might find it useful, so we're releasing it as open source under the MIT License.

The tool is written in Rust for performance and uses the Stripe API to fetch invoices, customers, and balance transactions. It handles all the edge cases we encountered - multiple address sources, pagination, fee extraction from balance transactions, etc.

Hope this helps other businesses streamline their tax reporting! 🚀
